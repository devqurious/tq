It all starts with a raspberry pi. Soon we will add a second (and third, and fourth) to build a K8s cluster. Which will do wonderful things like sprinkle the plans with just the right amount of water at just the right time. Got this pi from thingbits and they delivered in a couple of days which was nice.

Here it is now, in an enclosure that also doubles up as a heat sink. These babies are going to run continuously, so it seems like a heat sink is a good idea. Also got the heat sink + enclosure from thingbits. It's pretty easy to assemble. 4 screws and an allen key later, it's all ready and waiting.
