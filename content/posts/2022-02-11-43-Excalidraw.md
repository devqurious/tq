## Test the container

XXX: On the mac, test if the docker container works properly. 

```
docker pull excalidraw/excalidraw
```

```
docker run --rm -dit --name excalidraw -p 5000:80 excalidraw/excalidraw:latest
```

Now open a browser to http://localhost:5000/ and enjoy. It's time to deploy this container in the K3s cluster.


## Create the manifest

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: excalidraw-app
  labels:
    name: excalidraw-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: excalidraw-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: excalidraw-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: excalidraw-app
          image: drathaqm/home_sync
          imagePullPolicy: Always
```

## Create the namespace

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
	name: excalidra
```

Apply this configuration and verify the new namespace is present.

```
sudo kubectl get ns -A
```

## Deploy the containers

```
sudo kubectl apply -f excalidraw.yml -n excalidraw
sudo kubectl get pods -n excalidraw
```

Observe that the containers will _not_ start. Of course. The containers are likely not built to be run on Raspberry pi. Running the following command:

```
sudo kubectl get logs -f <pod name> -n excalidraw
```

...leads to the dreaded exception

```
standard_init_linux.go:219: exec user process caused: exec format error
```

Hello [12_Crashbackoff_Error](/posts/12_crashbackoff_error)

## Use a pi-compatible container

https://hub.docker.com/r/thisisbenny/excalidraw

And voila, it runs:

```
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
excalidraw-app-74667cc4df-6fhml 1/1 Running 0 91s
```

## Expose the service

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
 name: excalidraw
 labels:
 name: excalidraw
spec:
 ports:
 - port: 80
 nodePort: 30123
 targetPort: 80
 selector:
 name: excalidraw-app
 type: NodePort
```

Now you can access it using `http://<nodeIP>:30123`


## Access service using LB

Accessing Excalidraw using the node IP requires you to know where the app is running. Why bother? Let K3s figure it out. 

Using DNAT, forward port 30123 to the cluster by making the change in the DNAT rule.
