Google search is great, and it would be hard to get by without it. But it's also a dangerous thing in the hands of a minor - the wrong search, or a typo can expose the kid to all kinds of nonsense. With PiHole you can force every search to be a safe search and thereby reduce the risk greatly. You don't need to configure this on every device on your network - just do it once in PiHole. 

To force safe search create a CNAME entry as below: 

![](/images/pi/safe-search.png)

Try searching something, you should see safe search automatically enabled now.

![](/images/pi/safe.png)


Now if you were to search something inappropriate (deliberately, or not!) you're shown this:

![](/images/pi/blocked.png)

It can be circumvented. Only if your 10 year old knows DNS and how to configure it. That would be impressive, and scary at the same time.
