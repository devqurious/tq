It's a good idea to visualize where the cloud will sit among other things. We will start with one RPi box as the master. It will be controlled by a Macbook Pro - yes, there are no absolute masters in life. :)

The firewall here is pretty central to the network. It's where we configure DHCP, DNS and a whole lot more. Without it, setting up this network would be downright painful.
