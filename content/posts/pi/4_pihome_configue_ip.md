By default, the OS will assign a DHCP IP address to the node. But dynamically changing IP addresses are not a good idea when it comes to servers. To provide a static IP address, we need to do two things. 

![](/images/pi/dhcp_range.png)

First, ensure that the static IP address is outside the range used by the DHCP server. 

Second, assign a static IP address. This can be surprisingly hard with the new 'netplan' approach, and there is a lot of mis-information out there. Use https://graspingtech.com/ubuntu-server-18.04-static-ip/ to set this correctly. 

Make sure you select the correct interface name when configuring it. 

```
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0: <-- This needs to be correct!
      dhcp4: false
      addresses: [192.168.1.11/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers: 
        addresses: [1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8]
```

Now, you should be able to ping the pi from all the other machines on your network using the new statically assigned IP address.
