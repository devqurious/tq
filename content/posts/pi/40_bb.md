[Backups](/posts/pi/39_rsync_ssh/) are useless if you cannot browse them and restore the files you want. All the backed up files are on the longhorn volume, so the first thought was to create another container, running nginx, which could simply read the files expose them for download via a browser. That did not work because longhorn currently supports ReadWriteOnce, so if one container already has mounted the volume, there's no way _another_ container can mount the same volume. 

So the strategy shifts to adding the nginx functionality to the rsync container.

```

FROM nginx:latest

<snip>

# For the nginx file browser
RUN ln -sf /data /usr/share/nginx/html/data

COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
COPY default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d

RUN chmod 744 /entrypoint.sh

# SSH, RSync and NGinx
EXPOSE 22
EXPOSE 873
EXPOSE 80

# Taken together, this has the effect of /entrypoint.sh rsync_server
CMD ["rsync_server"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

```

- Instead of `FROM ubuntu:latest`, we said, `FROM nginx:latest`. 
- Create a soft link to the folder that contains all the files. 
- Copy over the nginx conf file to enable autoindex to true
- Expose port 80. 

Now build the image:

```
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 --tag drathaqm/home_sync --push .
```

The push it into the repository. Now redeploy the new container in the cluster. Before doing so, you do need to expose an additional service. 

```

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hc-bb-service
spec:
  # Expose the backup browser service on a static port on each node
  # so that we can access the service from outside the cluster
  type: NodePort

  # When the node receives a request on the static node (30038)
  # it will forward to all pods with the label 'name' set to 'hc-rsyncer-app'
  selector:
    name: hc-rsyncer-app
  ports:
    # Three types of ports for a service
    # port - port exposed internally in the cluster
    # nodePort - static port assigned on each of the nodes
    # targetPort - the container port to send the requests to.
    - port: 80
      nodePort: 30038
      targetPort: 80

```

Finally, make sure you have a DNAT rule to route traffic on TCP port 30038 to the cluster.

Now, open a browser to `http://172.16.16.16:30038/data/` and voila!

As you create new files on your source folder, these will automatically be rsynced over to your cluster, and stored in a 500 GB volume managed by Longhorn. If you need a file, simply open the above link and download it. And oh, since there are two replicas of this volume, your backup is protected even if one node (and it's SSD drive) were to crash. 

Shweet!
